# FacemaskDetector
<h1>Description</h1>
Hi welcome to my new deep learning project "Face Mask Detector". This project as the name suggests can predict if the person is wearing the mask correctly or not in front of the webcam.<br>
This project comprise of two python scripts namely,<br>
Data Training<br>
And finally Detect Mask.<br>
As all of the name suggest do there respective work.<br>

For this project I used TensorFlow is a math library that uses dataflow and differentiable programming to perform various tasks focused on training and inference of deep neural networks.
Keras is a high-level neural network library that runs on top of TensorFlow.
Keras and TensorFlow have been used to train the classifier to automatically detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not.
Imutils is a series of convenience functions to make basic image processing function and here it helps in the implementation by enabling us to find and list images in our dataset. 
And matplotlib to plot our training curves (here for plotting training loss and accuracy)
<br>

<h1>Requirements</h1>
<code>pip install imutils</code><br>
<code>pip install keras</code><br>
<code>pip install tensorflow</code><br>
<code>pip install opencv-python</code><br>
<code>pip install numpy</code><br>
<code>pip install scipy</code><br>
<code>pip install matplotlib</code><br>

<h1>How to run model?</h1>
  To Run just run <b>python train.py</b>. This is optional to run model as mask_detector.model is already placed at github path 
  
 <h1>How to test model?</h1>
  To Run just run <b>python detect_mask.py</b>
